# Keeper × Graph integration

Since v1.8.0, Keeper consults the L0 dependency graph (`aegis/runtime/context/graph.json`) on top of `code-spec-matrix.md` to widen its blast radius and classify drift severity.

## What changed in `/aegis-keeper after`

**Step 2** (mapear specs impactadas) now uses two sources, in order:

1. **Matrix** (`aegis/traceability/code-spec-matrix.md`) — primary mapping `file → spec`.
2. **Graph** — for files **without** a matrix entry, run `npx aegis-spec graph impact <file>`. Any of the impacted files that **do** have a matrix entry contribute their spec to the review list.

This means an edit in a file that has no spec can still trigger spec updates downstream — Keeper finds them via the import graph instead of giving up.

**Step 7** (atualizar `drift.md`) now records two new fields per spec:

- `blast_radius`: list of files affected by changes in this spec's files (top 20, then `+N more`).
- `severity`: classification per [drift-rules.md](../agents/aegis-keeper/references/drift-rules.md):
  - `LOW` — 0–1 reverse-deps direct
  - `MEDIUM` — 2–4
  - `HIGH` — 5+ (Keeper suggests `/aegis-reviewer`)

## What changed at the hook layer

The `Stop` hook (Claude Code) and `session.end` (Opencode) now do an **incremental graph update** for the dirty files at the end of every session, before the next `/aegis-keeper after` runs. Other engines (Cursor, Kimi, Codex) update the graph at commit time via the git pre-commit fallback (Phase 1).

If `aegis/runtime/context/graph.json` does not exist, the update is skipped silently. Run `npx aegis-spec graph build` once to bootstrap.

## What changed in `drift-check`

`aegis drift-check --format=json` now includes an `affected_files` array per blocking spec, computed as the union of graph-impact sets for the files mapped to that spec.

```json
{
  "severity": "high",
  "blocking": [
    {
      "spec": "aegis/specs/sdd/auth.md",
      "status": "🔴 pending",
      "action": "Run /aegis-keeper after",
      "affected_files": [
        "src/api/handler.js",
        "src/middleware/auth.js",
        "+12 more"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

PR comment integrations (e.g. CI bots) can lift this into the PR description so reviewers see the blast radius up front.

If the graph does not exist or the matrix is missing, `affected_files` is `null` — drift-check still works in degraded mode.

## Bootstrapping in an existing project

```bash
npx aegis-spec graph build
npx aegis-spec policy-index build   # optional, Phase 4
/aegis-keeper after            # in your engine
```

After that, the Stop hook keeps the graph fresh on every session.
